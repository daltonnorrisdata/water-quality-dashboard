Water Quality Dashboard

This project presents an interactive dashboard built in Tableau to visualize water quality trends across multiple monitoring sites at DFW International Airport, as part of the Clean Rivers Program.

Key Features

- **Average Trends Forecast:** Line graph showing quarterly trends of water quality parameters (e.g., Barium) from 2018 to 2025.
- **Heat Map Analysis:** Temporal heatmap displaying parameter concentrations by site over time.
- **Geospatial Visualization:** Interactive map pinpointing site locations with color-coded average result indicators.
- **Parameter Filtering:** Dynamic filters to explore individual contaminants (arsenic, chloride, E. coli, etc.).
- **Time-Series Interactivity:** Allows for quarterly analysis, anomaly detection, and long-term forecasting of parameter levels.

Tools Used

- Tableau (Primary dashboard creation)
- OpenStreetMap (for geospatial visualization)
- Excel / CSV (Source lab sample data from Clean Rivers Program)
- Python (used separately for data cleaning and pre-processing)

Use Case

This dashboard supports environmental compliance and stakeholder decision-making by offering clear, visual access to water quality data. It enables early detection of concerning parameter trends and allows facility managers to take corrective action before regulatory thresholds are breached.
